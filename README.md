### Introduction

- Courtesy of RecBole[[伯乐](https://recbole.io/cn/index.html)], the datasets and baseline models are available
- The KG-modified GCSAN, or PAGCN as we call it in this model, is runnable
- The LLM inference and causal-correction pipeline relies on an external platform, which rendered the code not runnable. They are only here for reference
- **More files will be released during revision, including an additional experiment regarding how the choice of LLMs could impact the model's performances**
