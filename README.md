### Introduction

- Courtesy of RecBole, the datasets and baseline models are available
- The KG-modified GCSAN, or PAGCN as we call it in this model, is runnable
- The LLM inference and causal-correction pipeline relies on a external platform, which rendered the code not runnable. They are only here for reference
